# Completion Rule

A checkbox may be marked complete only when:

- Implementation is complete
- Relevant automated tests pass
- Authorization is correct
- Branch isolation is verified where relevant
- Data-integrity requirements are satisfied
- UI loading/error states are handled where relevant
- Responsive QA is completed where relevant
- Realtime behavior is verified where relevant

Do not check items merely because the standalone prototype already contains the UI.
